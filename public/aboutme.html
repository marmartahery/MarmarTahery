          <p>
            I want to take the time to say thanks for exploring my site! This
            personal project really meant a lot to me because I wanted to be
            able to showcase my talent without carrying my laptop everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently a senior at California State University, Northridge
            and am set to graduate this May 2022! I’ll be getting my Bachelor’s
            of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computer Science really means a lot to me; it’s a field that a lot
            of my family members share, including my father who encouraged my
            love for technology and mathematics. Growing up, most of my friends
            would get normal child-friendly gifts such as Barbies and toy cars.
            For me, my dad got me the Snap Circuits Classic SC-300, a circuit
            board made especially for kids with STEM curiosities (this is not an
            ad, I just really loved this as a kid). Soon after, he bought me all
            sorts of CDs to help me develop a deeper understanding of the
            computer, some of them also helped improve my typing; I was typing
            roughly 70 wpm in middle school!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started college, my dad was really excited because we were
            finally able to have conversations regarding databases, hardware
            configurations, and loads more. One night I was cleaning out my
            closet and found some of those old CDs my dad gave me: Freddi Fish,
            Pajama Sam, Jump Start, and so many more! I really wanted to relive
            my childhood and play these games again, but they required older
            operating systems such as Windows 95 and 98.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was devastated but equally determined to get these games to work.
            When I told my dad about my plan, he was very reluctant at first but
            also curious. After doing some brainstorming, I managed to install a
            Virtual Machine and found an .iso file of Windows 98 online. Then,
            after configuring my disk drive to work on the virtual machine and
            waiting hours for everything to install, it worked! I was playing
            Freddi Fish on my Windows 10 laptop! My dad was in complete
            disbelief but also very proud. Moments like this make me excited for
            my future in computer science.

            time to learn more about me.
